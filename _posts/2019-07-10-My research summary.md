# Research Summary
> My research is interdisciplinary and focused on developing new types of fluorescence microscopes that could advance the work of other researchers and medical personnel in a wide variety of fields. My research interests include multiphoton microscopy (MPM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), super-resolution microscopy, high-speed imaging, deep tissue imaging, adaptive optics, computational imaging, and deep learning. In general, I design and build novel fluorescence microscopes with improved imaging speed, resolution, depth, and functionality over conventional microscopes.

## Speed
- Super-Sensitivity MPM-FLIM
- Saturation-Compensated FLIM
- Phase-Multiplexing FLIM

## Resolution
- Super-Resolution: Stepwise Optical Saturation (SOS)
- Super-Resolution: Deconvolution Stepwise Optical Saturation (DeSOS)
- Super-Resolution FLIM: Generalized Stepwise Optical Saturation (GSOS)

## Depth
- Sensorless Adaptive Optics
- Image Denoising by Deep Learning

## Functionality
- FLIM Phasor Plots
- Automatic Image Segmentation by K-Means Clustering
